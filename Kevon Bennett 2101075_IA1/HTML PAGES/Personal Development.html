        A few strengths of mine that I have noticed about myself are that I am self motivated, a critical thinker 
        and a natural born leader.</p>
        <h3>Self Motivated</h3>
        <img src="../Assests/Image/Self Motivation.jpg"  width="400" height="300">
        <p>
        I would describe myself as being self motivated because of my ambitious nature to achive success and fulfilment. 
        Over the past few years Ive been developing myself within this area by ensuring that I have a focused mindset towards achieving my goals in order to measure my progress so that I can self evaluate. 
        Along with this I also try to celebrate my accomplishments so that my self esteem has a boost. </p>
        <h3>Critical Thinker</h3>
        <img src="../Assests/Image/Critical Thinking.png"  width="450" height="300"  >
         <p>
        In terms of critical thinking I would say its a strength of mine because I am objective individual so I rely heavily of factual information.
        I try to develop this aspect of myself by gathering information then applying it to a problem or situation in order to come to a logical conclusion.</p>
        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <img  src="../Assests/Image/Leadership.jpg"  width="450"  height="300" >
        <p>   
         Leadership is another strength I display as I always like to encourage and inspire persons so that they can put their best foot forward in order to achieve the common goal that was set.
         I always try to improve this area of myself by assuming leadership roles in any given situation whether in clubs, socities,sports and even academic groups.</p>

         <p > The book title Twelve Pillars speaks about two friends that decided to meet up after not seeing each other for a while.
            They sat  and talked about life for a bit until the conversation strayed to charlie asking michael what are his goals for his career.
             Micheal was indecisive about his goals so charlie being an old timer he gave the much younger michael advice. He first asked him to write his goals down
             as writing it brings it into reality. Success doesnt come over night so he would have to start by changing his direction and then building out a plan
             to get there. Along this journey we can suffer from one of two pains, the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs while
             regret weighs tons. If you dont achieve your goals during your life time you will suffer from the crushing weight of regret. The best opportunities are those that
             align with your overall goals and should be what most of yout time is spent on. So time management is very important either you controlsyour time or it controls you.
            Surrounding yourself with the best is another way to achieve your goals. Persons who are winners and who are successful have a long lasting effect on us that influences 
            our destiny. When we associate ourselves with them does it help us to grow and inspires us to be persue our goals with a greater passion. Every relationship we have is an
            association and each association has either positive or negative affect on us. In order to achieve succes we have to constantly determine what kindof relationship you want with 
            people. Success in life is also not determined by formal education but the key is self education. Self educationis what you teach yourself this allows for constant improvement
            and growth. There are a few mainstays to learning that anyone can use to improve their lives. The first isto read books, the second to learn from successful peopleby observation
            and lastly by reflecting on personal experiences. Books are considered one of the greatest learning tools in human history. When we read them they open our minds to new ideas 
            which are seeds that grow and are applied become our achievements and successes. Based on what i read i could apply some of these strategies to my life by ensuring I efficiently 
            organize my time more to improve on my time management skills. Self education is another aspect i could apply to my life by just taking more time out to read so that my vocabulary can be 
            broaden.
