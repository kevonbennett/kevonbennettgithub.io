        A quote that my mom would always tell me while growing up was "If yuh wah good yuh nose affi run". 
        Over the years some traits I've noticed about my self as an individual were im very attentive,self motivated,proactive,patient,responsible,ambitious and a fast learner. 
        I typically tend to display my emotions verbally by communicating with others as I believe its a more rational approach in order to express my feelings and desires. 
        My hobbies and likes entails playing cricket,traveling and watching action packed movies on the other hand my dislikes are football and being unorganized.

        I believe that the test has validity in general as the statistical data collected was from a large sample size so this ensures more reliable results.
        Interms of my personal results they display some level of validity as a few of the traits represented have been noticed or mentioned to me by my peers or 
        family members.
